# CS 489 Web Development Project

Group project for CS 489 during SP25.

This is a **travel planner web application** that helps users research destinations, plan trips, and organize itineraries.

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), it features a fullstack architecture with a PostgreSQL database, modern UI using Tailwind CSS, and potential integrations with map or travel APIs.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
